## add_lead

> models::GetLeadResponse add_lead(add_lead_request)
Add a lead

Creates a lead. A lead always has to be linked to a person or an organization or both. All leads created through the Pipedrive API will have a lead source and origin set to `API`. Here's the tutorial for <a href=\"https://pipedrive.readme.io/docs/adding-a-lead\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">adding a lead</a>. If a lead contains custom fields, the fields' values will be included in the response in the same format as with the `Deals` endpoints. If a custom field's value hasn't been set for the lead, it won't appear in the response. Please note that leads do not have a separate set of custom fields, instead they inherit the custom fields' structure from deals. See an example given in the <a href=\"https://pipedrive.readme.io/docs/updating-custom-field-value\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">updating custom fields' values tutorial</a>.
